# TAPL (types and programming languages)
A collection of materials about types and programming languages, thanks to taking part in programming languages lecture during 2022 when i was pursuing master degree in peking univeristy.


The implementations of typecheckers and simple interpreters are written in OCaml. Since we focus on type system only, we then directly use Ocaml tools `ocamllex` and `ocamlyacc` as the lexer and parser.
